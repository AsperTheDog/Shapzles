# Shapzles
Shapzles is a local 3 player game about cooperating to find the correct puzzle.

# Setup
The game is made to be played with 3 different screens. This is done because each player must only see their own screen. Thus, the specific setup is not important as long as no two screens can be visible at the same time from any point of the playing area.  
We, however, recommend to put the screens in a triangle formation where each screen is a side of the triangle. This allows players to see each other without any screen other than theirs.

The game will launch a fourth small screen with information about the game state as well as some buttons:
 - Reset: Restarts the timer, pause the game, reset to the first level and restore all hearts
 - Pause: Toggles pause mode. When in pause mode the countdown will stop and the symbols will disappear. Players cannot interact with the game while in pause mode
 - Solve puzzle: This button will solve the current active puzzle. The button must be use with care, as it may break the flow of the system and cause bugs.
> It is important to note that these buttons are for admin control and debug use, therefore they may ignore some assumptions the system does when it comes to progression and game state. Reset and Pause are relatively robust, but may still cause bugs if abused.

# Controls

The game is made to be played with a controller, but a keyboard can be used as well. To move the dials the right joystick or the dpad can be used for a controller and the arrows for a keyboard. Fullscreen can be toggled by pressing F11 on a keyboard.

# How to play

Each player must stay in front of a screen and refrain from looking at other player's screens. One player will have a controller that they will use to advance in the game.   
Players are allowed to speak and gesture as they see, and can communicate in whatever language they so choose.

**THE GAME IS MADE TO BE PLAYED BLINDLY AND TO DISCOVER THE RULES BY YOURSELF AS YOU PLAY, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ PAST HERE BEFORE PLAYING**

The main objective of the game is to find out what is the correct combination of symbols that will form the answer.
- The main screen (the one visible to the player with the controller) will show two dials and the answer. They will have to describe what the answer is to the other two players so they can decypher the correct positions of the dial
- The other two screens will show a grid of symbols encoded with letters of numbers (depending on the player). Given the information of the other players they have to discover what is the correct component that combine with the components on the other screen form the solution.
